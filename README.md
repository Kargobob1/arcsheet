## 🚀 Overview

Navigating the economy of ARC Raiders requires knowing exactly what to keep, what to sell, and what to recycle. This tool provides instant access to data regarding:

*   **Item Values:** Sell price vs. Recycling yield calculations.
*   **Crafting Requirements:** Upgrade paths for Gunsmith, Explosives, Gear Bench, and more.
*   **Quest Items:** Specific items to hoard for quest completion.
*   **Keycards:** Locations and descriptions for all access keys.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Smart Search:** Instantly find items by name, category, or even by what they recycle into (e.g., searching "Steel Spring" shows items that yield it).
*   **Recycling Index:** Visual indicators showing whether recycling an item results in a profit (Green/Positive %) or a loss (Red/Negative %) compared to selling it directly.
*   **Categorized Database:**
    *   **Safe to Sell:** Items with low utility or better sell values.
    *   **Expedition Projects:** Phase 1-4 tracking.
    *   **Workshop Upgrades:** Detailed requirements for all stations including Scrappy and Utility.
    *   **High-Tier Components:** Best donor items for rare materials.
    *   **Key Locations:** Maps keys to their specific in-game locations.
*   **Visual Rarity System:** Color-coded cards (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary) matching in-game aesthetics.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for use on second monitors or mobile devices while gaming.
